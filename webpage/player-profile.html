        <p class="boxheaderP">Primary Position: Shooting Guard</p>
      </header>
      <div class="textBox">
        <p class="boxP">Kobe is a 6 feet 4 inches (1.93m) shooting guard that plays in a similar playstyle to Michael Jordan.  Like Jordan, he is well known for his fade-away jump shot.  As such, cries of Kobe's name is often heard by basketball players when they attempt a fade-away shot.  Bryant is known for both his offensive and defensive abilities. In particular, his ability to clutch in tense situations is incredible. Kobe is known to take insane shots while being defended by two or three players.  On this matter, critics state that Kobe is far too selfish with his gameplay. However, Kobe has closed the mouths of the critics countless times with his ability to close out games with the buzzer beater.  He is knwon as the league's premier closer.</p>
        <p class="boxP">Kobe's work ethic is incredible.  Especially in the later years of his career, Bryant often experienced severe injuries in his knee, shoulder and face.  He is known to persevere through the pain and participate in practices or games.  While this decision seems risky, Lakers without Kobe lacked soul and performed poor in almost all games.</p>
        <div class="quote">
          <h2>“Kobe [in the year 2004-2007] was the most alienated superstar the NBA had ever seen”</h2>
          <p>--Forbes(2014)</p>
        </div>
        <p class="boxP">Kobe's relationship with other players is known to be fairly poor in the early years.  Due to his competitive nature, he was widely considered to be a player difficult to play with and against.  However, after the departure of Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe took the role of the team's mentor.  His atmosphere changed from the once "selfish, high-volume shooter" to a Hall-of-Fame material player that is able to work as a team and lead the team.</p>
        <div class="quote wideStyle">
          <h2>“[Bryant] embraced the team and his teammates, calling them up when we were on the road and inviting them out to dinner.  It was as if the other players were now his partners, not his personal spear-carriers”</h2>
          <p>--Phil Jackson</p>
